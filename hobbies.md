## Fueling the Engine

If I'm not at my desk, I'm probably sweating it out somewhere in the gym or roaming around the streets.

## ❄️ Madison Firsts: Core Memories

Moving to Wisconsin brought some unforgettable firsts.

**The Northern Lights:** I got incredibly lucky and witnessed the Aurora Borealis right here in Madison. Capturing those green and purple pillars over the lake was surreal.

**First Snowfall:** Coming from a tropical climate, my first proper snowfall was magical. (Ask me again in February if I still feel the same way! 🥶)

## Fitness & Sports

Back in India, **Cricket** was everything. I spent years on the pitch, and the strategy of the game is still ingrained in me.

Since moving to Madison, I've traded the cricket bat for a paddle. **Pickleball** is my latest addiction. It's fast, social, and the perfect way to disconnect from the stress of grad school.

**My Routine:**
- **Strength Training:** Lifting heavy clears the mental load of research
- **Running:** My meditation. Exploring Madison's lakes on foot is how I debug problems in the background
- **Pickleball:** Currently obsessed (always looking for a doubles partner!)

## Live Music & Concerts

There's no feeling quite like the energy of a massive crowd. I love the chaos and connection of big music gigs.

I listen to lo-fi beats when coding, but I crave the volume and atmosphere of live performances to recharge. Whether it's a stadium tour or a local music festival, I'm there for the experience.

## Cooking as Therapy

For me, cooking isn't just about food—it's a form of stress relief.

After a long day of fine-tuning LLMs or dealing with AWS errors, there's something grounding about chopping vegetables and balancing spices. It's a tactile, sensory experience that pulls me out of my head.

## Gaming

I still make time to game. I love strategy and story-driven games—environments where you have to plan ahead or solve complex puzzles. Keeps the problem-solving part of my brain engaged in a low-stakes environment.

**Favorites:** *Civilization VI*, *The Witcher 3*, *Portal*

## Travel & Exploration

I love exploring new places, trying local food, and experiencing different cultures. Exploring Europe is in my bucket list

**Dream Destinations:**
- **Iceland:** I've seen the lights in Madison, but I still want to see them over an Icelandic glacier
- **Japan:** For the unique blend of ancient tradition and futuristic tech
