## 👋 Hey, I'm Satya

Most people call me Satya. I'm a Computer Science grad student at **UW–Madison**, and before this, I spent two years building production ML systems at **Tata AIA Life Insurance** in Mumbai.

## 🗺️ The Path Here

I grew up in India and completed my **Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech)** at **IIT Bombay**. From there, I pivoted to insurance tech.

Insurance might not sound exciting, but it taught me something valuable: **the best AI isn't the fanciest algorithm—it's the one that actually solves someone's problem.**

At Tata AIA, I built systems that reviewed insurance claims automatically, fine-tuned models to understand complex policy documents, and created chatbots that people didn't immediately want to rage-quit. Seeing my code help someone get their claim processed faster—that felt real.

After two years, I wanted to go deeper. Not just apply ML, but understand it from first principles. That's why I'm at UW–Madison now.

## 💡 What I Care About

**Building things that work:** I'm less interested in state-of-the-art benchmarks and more interested in systems that don't break at 3 AM. Production ML taught me that reliability often matters more than raw accuracy.

**Reinforcement Learning:** There's something fascinating about systems that learn through trial and error—getting better over time without explicit instruction.

**Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Right now, I'm experimenting with **LangGraph** and **CrewAI**. The question that drives me: *can we build AI systems that collaborate like a good team does?*

## 🧠 How I Think About Work

I believe in **learning by doing**. Reading papers is great, but implementing them from scratch teaches you what the paper didn't say. I try to share what I learn—partly to help others, partly because explaining something is the best way to realize you don't understand it yet.

I also believe in balance. My best ideas don't come while staring at code—they come while cooking, walking around Madison's lakes, or talking with friends about completely unrelated things.

## 🎲 Random Facts

**The JEE Grind:** I tested in the **top 0.3%** of 1.58 million students in India's engineering entrance exam. It was stressful. I don't recommend it.

**Web Coord @ IITB:** I managed the website for **Techfest**, handling traffic from thousands of users during registration. Great crash course in scalability (and what *not* to do).

**Night Owl:** I debug better at 2 AM than 2 PM. I'm not proud of this.

**Chef Mode:** I'm trying to master **Biryani**. It's significantly harder than training neural networks.
