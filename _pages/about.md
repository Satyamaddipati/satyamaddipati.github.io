## The Story So Far

Hey! I'm Satya Bhargav Maddipati, but most people call me Satya. I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, pursuing my MS in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning and AI.

### My Journey

My tech journey started at **IIT Bombay**, where I completed my B.Tech-M.Tech dual degree. Those five years were intense, eye-opening, and filled with late-night coding sessions, incredible friends, and the realization that I absolutely love building things with code.

After graduating, I joined **Tata AIA Life Insurance** as a Data Scientist. Now, I know what you're thinking - "Insurance? Really?" But hear me out! It was actually an incredible opportunity to see how AI can transform traditional industries. I got to:

- Build autonomous AI agents that could review insurance claims (saving hours of manual work!)
- Fine-tune large language models to understand complex policy documents
- Create chatbots that could actually help people (not the frustrating kind!)
- Work with massive amounts of real-world data

The best part? Seeing my systems actually help real people get their insurance claims processed faster. That's when I realized the true power of AI isn't just in fancy algorithms - it's in solving real human problems.

### Why UW-Madison?

After two years in industry, I wanted to dive deeper into the theory and cutting-edge research. UW-Madison was the perfect choice - excellent research opportunities, a beautiful campus (those lakes! 😍), and a vibrant AI/ML community.

### What Drives Me

I'm passionate about:

- **Making AI Practical**: I love bridging the gap between research papers and production systems
- **LLMs & Agentic Systems**: The idea that AI agents can collaborate and solve complex problems fascinates me
- **Learning in Public**: Sharing what I learn and contributing to the community
- **Interdisciplinary Work**: The best innovations happen at the intersection of different fields

### My Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Continuous Learning**: Technology moves fast, and staying curious is the only way to keep up
- **Building > Talking**: Ideas are cheap; execution is everything
- **Collaboration**: The best work happens when diverse minds come together
- **Balance**: Being a good engineer means being a well-rounded person

### Fun Facts

- 🎯 I was in the top 0.3% of 1.58 million students in JEE Mains (India's engineering entrance exam)
- 🏆 Won a Bronze medal in Inter-IIT competitions
- 🌐 Served as Web Coordinator for Techfest IIT Bombay (Asia's largest science & tech festival!)
- 🧠 I can debug code better at 2 AM than at 2 PM (is this a superpower or a problem?)

### Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to meet new people, collaborate on interesting projects, or chat about AI, technology, and life. Feel free to reach out!
