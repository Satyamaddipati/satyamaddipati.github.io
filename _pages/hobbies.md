## When I'm Not Coding...

Life is too short to only stare at terminals and debug logs! Here's what I do when I need to recharge my batteries (and my creativity).

---

## 🎮 Gaming

I'm a casual gamer who loves strategy and story-driven games. There's something about solving complex problems in games that translates well to debugging code at 3 AM!

**Current Favorites:**
- Strategy games where planning matters
- Open-world RPGs with great storytelling
- Puzzle games that make you think differently

Gaming taught me patience, strategic thinking, and that sometimes you need to try a completely different approach to solve a problem - skills that translate surprisingly well to ML research!

## 📚 Reading

I'm an avid reader with eclectic tastes. You'll find everything from sci-fi novels to philosophy books on my nightstand.

**What I'm Reading:**
- **Tech & AI:** Papers on LLMs, agentic systems, and the latest ML breakthroughs
- **Science Fiction:** Love exploring how authors imagine AI and technology's future
- **Non-fiction:** Psychology, philosophy, and how humans think and make decisions
- **Biographies:** Learning from the journeys of interesting people

**Favorites:**
- *Superintelligence* by Nick Bostrom
- *Gödel, Escher, Bach* by Douglas Hofstadter
- Anything by Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke

## 🍳 Cooking & Food Adventures

I love experimenting in the kitchen! Cooking is like programming - you follow a recipe (algorithm), adjust parameters (salt, spice), and iterate until you get it right.

**Specialties:**
- Indian cuisine (obviously! 😄)
- Experimenting with fusion dishes
- Attempting to recreate restaurant favorites at home
- Finding the best local food spots in Madison

**Current Quest:** Mastering the perfect biryani. It's harder than training a neural network, I swear!

---

## 🏃‍♂️ Fitness & Sports

Code runs better when the coder is healthy! I try to stay active and balance out all those hours sitting at a desk.

**Activities:**
- Running around Madison's beautiful lakes
- Badminton (played competitively back in school)
- Gym sessions (trying to stay consistent!)
- Long walks while listening to podcasts

---

## 🎵 Music

Music is my constant companion while coding, studying, or just relaxing. My Spotify playlists are as diverse as my interests!

**Currently Vibing To:**
- Lo-fi beats while coding
- Indian classical/fusion music
- Podcast episodes on AI, tech, and philosophy
- Occasionally some good old Bollywood hits for nostalgia

---

## 🌍 Travel & Exploration

I love exploring new places, trying local food, and experiencing different cultures. Every place teaches you something new!

**Dream Destinations:**
- Japan (for the tech, culture, and food!)
- Iceland (Northern Lights on my bucket list)
- New Zealand (Lord of the Rings locations!)
- More national parks across the US

**Madison Adventures:**
- Discovering hidden coffee shops
- Exploring the lakefront trails
- Finding the best spots for sunset photos
- Attending local events and meetups

---

## 🎨 Creative Pursuits

**Photography:** Amateur photographer capturing moments and landscapes. Madison's changing seasons provide endless opportunities!

**Writing:** Occasionally blog about tech, AI, and my learning journey. Writing helps crystallize my thoughts.

**Side Projects:** Always tinkering with random ideas - from building small apps to experimenting with new ML techniques.

---

## 🧘‍♂️ Mindfulness & Learning

I believe in continuous personal growth, not just technical skills.

**Practices:**
- Meditation (trying to build a consistent habit!)
- Journaling to reflect on learnings and experiences
- Online courses on topics outside my comfort zone
- Attending tech talks, workshops, and meetups

---

## Why This Matters

These hobbies aren't just distractions - they make me a better engineer and researcher:
- **Reading** expands my perspective and creativity
- **Cooking** teaches patience and experimentation
- **Gaming** improves problem-solving and strategic thinking
- **Fitness** keeps my mind sharp
- **Travel** exposes me to new ideas and cultures

Additionally, the best conversations occur when you have diverse interests beyond your work.
