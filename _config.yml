I'm Satya, a grad student at **UW-Madison**, genuinely passionate about building AI systems that work in the real world. With a background from **IIT Bombay** and experience at **Tata AIA Life Insurance**, I've learned that great technology begins with understanding real problems—then relentlessly iterating until they are solved.

## 🌱 From Curiosity to Impact: My Air Quality Journey

I've always been the kind of person who asks, "Why?" and "What if?" Growing up in India, I witnessed our cities transform—encompassing more infrastructure and growth, yet also days when stepping outside felt like breathing through a blanket.

### The Question That Started Everything

During my time at **IIT Bombay**, I often thought: *If we can predict weather days in advance, why can't we predict air quality?* That question became my dual degree thesis—and honestly, one of the most fulfilling projects I've worked on.

### Building Solutions, Not Just Models

I dove into creating forecasting systems by:
- Analyzing **time series patterns** that revealed how pollution evolves
- Building **ML ensembles** (Random Forest & XGBoost) that learned from real, messy urban data
- Integrating **meteorological factors** with traffic and industrial activity
- Creating **city-specific predictions** that understood local patterns

### Why This Matters

When my models started accurately predicting air quality indices 3-5 days in advance, I realized that this could help parents decide when to keep asthmatic children indoors, enable cities to manage traffic proactively, and help communities take protective action.

**That's what drives me—building technology that genuinely adds value to people's lives, not just impressive benchmarks.**

## 🚀 What I'm Exploring Now

Right now, I'm diving deep into:
- **Agent architectures** with LangGraph & CrewAI—building systems that can reason and act
- **RAG optimization**—because retrieval quality matters as much as generation  
- **LLM evaluation**—how do we know our AI systems are reliable?
- **Cost-performance tradeoffs**—making powerful AI accessible and practical

I'm always experimenting, always learning, and always looking for the next challenge.
