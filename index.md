## Hi, I'm Satya

I'm a Computer Science Master's student at UW–Madison with a dual degree from IIT Bombay. I have over 2 years of industry experience building production ML systems, and I'm hungry to learn more. I specialize in large language model pipelines, RAG systems, and autonomous agents.

My goal is straightforward: to transform complex data into reliable, automated decisions.

Currently seeking Summer 2026 ML Engineering internships (May–August). [Resume](/assets/resume.pdf)

## What I Do

I build AI systems that actually work in production. At Tata AIA Life Insurance, I developed multi-agent evaluation systems, RAG pipelines for insurance claims, and fine-tuned transformers for document classification. These weren't just academic exercises—they saved thousands of person-hours and directly contributed to business growth.

Previously, I worked on air quality forecasting during my tenure at IIT Bombay. Growing up in India, I witnessed firsthand how pollution impacted daily life. My thesis question was simple: if we can predict the weather, why not air quality? I built ensemble models that could forecast pollution levels 3-5 days in advance for major cities.

The common thread? I'm drawn to problems that matter to real people.

## What I'm Learning

I have just completed my first semester at UW–Madison, where I delved deeply into machine learning theory, human-computer interaction, and database systems. Next semester, I'm taking foundation models, computer vision, big data, and more deep learning.

Right now, reinforcement learning has caught my attention. There's something fascinating about systems that learn through interaction and improve over time. I'm exploring how RL can make AI agents more adaptive and autonomous.

Beyond coursework, I'm experimenting with LangGraph, CrewAI, and various fine-tuning approaches. The goal is always the same: move beyond demos to systems that teams can actually depend on.
