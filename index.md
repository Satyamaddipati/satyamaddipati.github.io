# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Satya**, a grad student at UW-Madison who's passionate about building AI systems that actually work (and occasionally debugging them at 2 AM with coffee in hand ☕).

> *"Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe."* - Abraham Lincoln  
> (This is basically my approach to ML projects 😄)

## Quick Intro

- 🎓 MS Computer Science student at **UW-Madison** (Machine Learning & AI)
- 🤖 Previously built **production AI systems** at Tata AIA Life Insurance
- 🧠 Love fine-tuning LLMs, building agentic systems, and making AI practical
- 🌱 Always learning something new (currently: advanced RAG & RL techniques)
- 🌍 From India → IIT Bombay → Mumbai → Madison, WI
- ☕ Coffee enthusiast (my code-to-coffee ratio is 1:3)

## Fun Facts About Me

- 🎯 Cracked JEE Mains in top 0.3% (out of 1.58 million students!) - that's like finding a needle in a haystack, but the needle is also solving calculus
- 🏆 Bronze medalist at Inter-IIT competitions
- 🌐 Was Web Coordinator for Techfest IIT Bombay (Asia's largest tech festival!)
- 🍳 Can make a decent biryani (though my LLMs are more consistent than my cooking)
- 🎮 Believe strategy games make you a better programmer
- 📚 Currently reading: *Gödel, Escher, Bach* (again, because once is never enough)

## What I'm About

I'm not just about code and algorithms (though I do love those!). I believe the best engineers are curious humans who:
- **Build things** that solve real problems
- **Learn continuously** because tech never stops evolving
- **Collaborate** because the best ideas come from diverse perspectives  
- **Stay balanced** through hobbies, fitness, and exploration

**And I'm here to build that future, one line of code (and one cup of coffee) at a time.** 🚀☕
