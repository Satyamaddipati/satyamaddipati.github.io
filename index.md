I'm Satya, a CS grad student at UW–Madison. I did my undergrad at IIT Bombay, where I also completed a dual degree thesis on air quality forecasting.

These days, I work on LLMs, RAG systems, and agentic workflows—basically trying to make AI systems that actually work in production and don't fall apart when you deploy them.

Before grad school, I spent a couple years at Tata AIA Life Insurance as an Assistant Manager in their data science team. Built some cool stuff there: multi-agent systems, LLM pipelines, automation tools that teams actually used.

## What I'm into

**LLM Engineering** – Fine-tuning models, building RAG pipelines, getting agents to do useful things with LangGraph and CrewAI. Lately obsessed with evaluation frameworks because "it works on my laptop" isn't a real metric.

**Classic ML** – Still love a good XGBoost model. Time series, forecasting, the usual suspects. Sometimes the old tools are the right tools.

**Production Systems** – Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, Docker, AWS. If it needs to run reliably and not break at 3am, I'm interested.

## Air Quality Research at IIT Bombay

During my dual degree, I worked on predicting air pollution in Indian cities. If you've been to Delhi or Mumbai during winter, you know why this matters.

The interesting part was modeling how weather patterns interact with urban chaos—traffic density, construction activity, industrial emissions, all feeding into air quality indices.

**The approach:** Time series analysis combined with Random Forest and XGBoost models. Integrated meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed) with emission data to forecast pollution levels days in advance.

Ended up with solid predictive accuracy, but more importantly learned a lot about working with messy real-world environmental data and the constraints of urban modeling.

## Things I've shipped

- Multi-agent LLM evaluation system → 89% correlation with human raters
- Claims automation pipeline → 35% reduction in manual review time
- Document classifier for insurance forms → 94% accuracy
- Production ML systems at Tata AIA contributing to business growth

---

## Current focus

- Better agent architectures using LangGraph
- RAG systems that don't hallucinate confidently  
- Evaluation methods beyond just accuracy scores
- Making LLMs reliable enough for actual production use
