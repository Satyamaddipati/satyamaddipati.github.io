## Hi, I'm Satya

I'm a Computer Science Master's student at UW–Madison with a dual degree from IIT Bombay. I have over 2 years of industry experience building production ML systems, and I'm hungry to learn more.

My goal is straightforward: to transform complex data into reliable, automated decisions.

## What I've Done

At Tata AIA Life Insurance, I built multi-agent evaluation systems, RAG pipelines for insurance claims, and fine-tuned transformers for document classification. These systems saved thousands of person-hours and contributed directly to business growth.

Before that, I worked on air quality forecasting at IIT Bombay. Growing up in India, pollution affected daily life. My question was simple: if we can predict weather, why not air quality? I built models that could forecast pollution levels 3-5 days in advance for major cities.

I'm drawn to problems that matter to real people.

## What I'm Learning

I just completed my first semester at UW–Madison, diving deep into machine learning theory, human-computer interaction, and database systems. Next semester, I'm taking foundation models, computer vision, big data, and more deep learning.

Right now, reinforcement learning has caught my attention. There's something fascinating about systems that learn through interaction and improve over time. I'm exploring how RL can make AI agents more adaptive and autonomous.

Beyond coursework, I'm experimenting with LangGraph, CrewAI, and various fine-tuning approaches. The goal is always the same: move beyond demos to systems that teams can actually depend on.
