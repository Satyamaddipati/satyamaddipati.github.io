# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Satya**, a grad student at UW-Madison who's passionate about building AI systems that actually work (and occasionally debugging them at 2 AM with coffee in hand ☕).

## Quick Intro

- 🎓 MS Computer Science student at **UW-Madison** (Machine Learning & AI)
- 🤖 Previously built **production AI systems** at Tata AIA Life Insurance
- 🧠 Love fine-tuning LLMs, building agentic systems, and making AI practical
- 🌱 Always learning something new (currently: advanced RAG & RL techniques)
- 🌍 From India → IIT Bombay → Mumbai → Madison, WI

## What I'm About

I'm not just about code and algorithms (though I do love those!). I believe the best engineers are curious humans who:
- **Build things** that solve real problems
- **Learn continuously** because tech never stops evolving
- **Collaborate** because the best ideas come from diverse perspectives  
- **Stay balanced** through hobbies, fitness, and exploration
