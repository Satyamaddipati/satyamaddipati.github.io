## Hi, I'm Satya! 👋

I'm a grad student at UW-Madison, diving deep into the world of AI and Machine Learning. My journey began at IIT Bombay and led me into the exciting world of insurance technology (yes, AI can make insurance more interesting!).

### Quick Facts About Me

- 🎓 Currently pursuing MS in Computer Science at UW-Madison
- 🤖 Previously built AI systems that processed thousands of insurance claims daily
- 🌱 Always learning something new (currently: reinforcement learning & advanced RAG techniques)
- 🌍 From India, now exploring the Midwest
- ☕ Fueled by coffee and curiosity

### What Gets Me Excited

I'm fascinated by how we can make AI systems more intelligent, reliable, and actually useful. Whether it's fine-tuning an LLM to understand insurance policies or building multi-agent systems that collaborate like a team, I love the challenge of turning complex problems into elegant solutions.

But I'm more than just a tech person! I believe the best engineers are well-rounded humans who draw inspiration from diverse experiences. That's why you'll find me dabbling in various hobbies, exploring new places, and constantly seeking new perspectives.
