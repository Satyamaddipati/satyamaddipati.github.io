## About Me

I'm Satya, a graduate student in Computer Science at UW–Madison focusing on Machine Learning, LLMs, and applied AI systems.

Previously, I worked as an Assistant Manager – Data Science at Tata AIA Life Insurance, where I built production-grade AI systems, multi-agent workflows, and LLM-based automation pipelines used across business teams.

My work centers around:
- Large Language Models & fine-tuning  
- Agentic AI systems (LangGraph, CrewAI)  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Practical ML systems and production deployment

## What I Do

- **LLM Engineering:** fine-tuning, evaluation, RAG pipelines, agents  
- **Machine Learning:** model development, experimentation, optimization  
- **AI Systems:** building reliable, scalable, end-to-end workflows  
- **Software & Infra:** Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, Docker, AWS/GCP  

---

## Current Focus

- Building advanced agent systems with LangGraph  
- Improving RAG performance with adaptive retrieval  
- Exploring evaluation frameworks for LLM reliability  

---

## Highlights

- Designed multi-agent LLM evaluation system with 89% correlation to human scoring  
- Reduced manual insurance claims review by 35% with agentic automation  
- Achieved 94% document-classification accuracy through custom fine-tuning  
- Delivered ML systems contributing to significant business growth at Tata AIA
