## What I'm Working On Now

As a graduate student at UW-Madison, I'm exploring the cutting edge of Machine Learning and AI. Here's what's keeping me busy and excited!

---

## 🎓 Academic Journey at UW-Madison

**MS Computer Science** (Sep 2025 - May 2027)  
Focus Areas: Machine Learning, AI, Database Systems

I'm currently diving deep into:
- Advanced Machine Learning techniques
- Database system architectures and optimization
- Research methodologies and paper implementation
- Building production-ready ML systems

**Why these areas?** Because the future needs AI systems that are not just smart, but also scalable, reliable, and actually useful in the real world.

## 🔬 Current Research Interests

### 1. Agentic AI Systems

I'm fascinated by how we can make AI agents that:
- Collaborate with each other to solve complex problems
- Make autonomous decisions reliably
- Learn from their interactions and improve over time

**What I'm exploring:**
- Multi-agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI)
- Agent orchestration patterns
- Reliability and safety in autonomous systems

**Recent Work:** Built a multi-agent evaluation platform that compares different LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) with automated judging, achieving 89% correlation with human expert ratings.

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is revolutionizing how LLMs access and use external knowledge. I'm working on:
- Advanced chunking strategies for better context retrieval
- Hybrid search approaches (semantic + keyword)
- Re-ranking techniques to surface the most relevant information
- Building RAG systems that actually work in production

**Real Impact:** My RAG-based insurance chatbot helped customers understand complex policy documents by breaking them down intelligently and providing accurate, context-aware responses.

### 3. LLM Fine-Tuning & Optimization

Making large language models work for specific domains is both an art and science. I'm interested in:
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLORA, PEFT)
- Domain adaptation techniques
- Balancing accuracy, speed, and cost
- Evaluation methodologies for LLMs

**Experience:** Fine-tuned 5+ models (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5) for document classification, achieving 94% accuracy with significantly reduced inference costs.

- Designed RAG-based system with GPT-4 & LlamaIndex
- Implemented semantic chunking and contextual retrieval
- Added re-ranking for enhanced accuracy
- **Impact:** Helped customers understand complex insurance products
- **Learning:** Good UX matters as much as good AI

#### 3. Document Classification System
- Fine-tuned multiple LLM models for insurance document types
- Achieved 94% accuracy across diverse document categories
- Deployed with efficient inference pipeline
- **Learning:** Domain-specific fine-tuning beats generic models every time

#### 4. Insurance Recommender System
- Built personalized recommendation engine
- Processed customer records, interactions, and behavioral patterns
- Enhanced customer lifecycle value and cross-selling opportunities
